## The main configurations for MMT Voyager
##
##
## Configurations are introduced in the same order as they are needed by the migration tools

############################
### 1) Data export phase ###
## Voyager DB dumps are fetched and delivered for the data transformation phase

# Absolute/full path to the script used to extract data from the VoyagerDB-server into the Koha-server.
# See the extractor-dir for example implementations.
exportPipelineScript: '/home/koha/MMT-Voyager/secret/voyagerToTransformer_fetchDataViaSSHJumpHost.sh'

# From where the files exported from Voyager are found?
voyagerExportDir: '/home/koha/MMT-Voyager/VoyagerExports'

####################################
### 2) Data transformation phase ###
## Exported DB rows are mangled into Koha-objects

# Enable multithreading by defining workers.
workers: 3

# Holdings transformation strategy to use.
# The way holdings records are used in various databases vary, hence one transformation set of rules wont work for all source databases.
holdingsTransformationModule: HAMK

# If the item doesn't have a price or a replacementprice, use this default.
defaultReplacementPrice: 0

# ISIL-code for the migrated organization
# Used primarily in the MARC record transformations.
organizationISILCode: FI-J

# Set the Patron home library to this value for all patrons. Leave empty to use the LocationId-translation table.
patronHomeLibrary:

# Which strategy to use to validate phone numbers
# See MMT::Validator::Phone for available strategies
phoneNumberValidationStrategy: JYU

#############################
### 3) Data loading phase ###
## Exported DB rows are mangled into Koha-objects

# Absolute path to the script used to import the transformed data into Koha
# See the importer-dir for example implementations.
importPipelineScript: '/home/koha/MMT-Voyager/VoyagerExports'

# Where the built library system objects are stored to be transported to Koha?
kohaImportDir: '/home/koha/MMT-Voyager/KohaImports'
